# pereiragc.github.io

Repository for my personal website. The theme is [academic-minima](https://github.com/academicbio/academic-minima).

For the github pages to work, I had to set 
```yaml 
remote_theme: academic-minima
```

instead of the suggested
```yaml 
theme: academic_minima
```

## Building/serving

To build: 
```shell
bundle exec jekyll build --watch
```

To serve:
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```
