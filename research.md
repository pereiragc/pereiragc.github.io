## Job market paper
**Risk Premia, Informality and the Business Cycle** <br />
with Livio Maya. 

*Abstract.*  This paper introduces the idea that the breakdown of the workforce into formal and informal jobs is akin to an aggregate portfolio choice. The decision to formalize trades off the higher productivity of formal workers with the risk of not being able to fire them due to large regulatory costs. We embed this payoff structure in a business cycle search model with formality choice by employers, who assess the value of a match using discount rates that allow for a time-varying price of risk. We calibrate the model with data from Brazil. The model produces two main patterns: a payoff effect that makes informal firms’ firing sensitive to the business cycle, and a portfolio rebalancing effect, whereby a higher price of risk during downturns induces firms to shift their hiring towards informal workers. The model-predicted cyclicality of transitions from unemployment to formal and informal jobs, as well as the cyclicality of transitions to unemployment – both of which we do not target in our estimation – are consistent with the data. The predictions are at odds with the data when the model is calibrated with constant discount rates. The results indicate that properly accounting for the price of risk is essential for understanding the dynamics of the informal sector.

**Income Risk and the Welfare Effects of Informal Labor Activity** (draft coming soon) <br />
with Livio Maya. 

*Abstract.*
In this paper, we argue that informal labor activity is not as much a cause of imperfect social insurance and risk-sharing as it is a consequence of it. We study a standard heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic model in which the endowment process follows from a search model built and calibrated to generate stylized income/informality facts from Brazilian household-level data. We simulate the economy's response to the repression of informal labor activity. The exercise indicates that risk matters: while expected lifetime income significantly increases across skill groups (with higher wages and lower unemployment rates), variation in welfare levels can be as low as -4\% of lifetime consumption for new entrant workers of the lowest skill level, while gains typically occur among workers with higher skill. The main channel involves lower job-finding rates that render the income process riskier. Low-skill households experience losses as a consequence of the minimum-wage assumption we adopt to match the patterns of income gap between formal and informal workers observed in the data. Our results are robust to large general equilibrium effects, as well as various extensions of the baseline model. They suggest that public policies designed to unilaterally suppress informality potentially lead to more economic losers than winners, which justify why we don't observe goverments adopting them in general. They also convey the idea that informality spreads more easily among developing countries not only as a result of lower productivity but also as a result of reduced capacity of their households to insure against income shocks.
